# Girls-in-ICT-The-Gambia-Styleguide-and-Modules-Library

My name is Anna Dibba, studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of The Gambia. 

This is my project for the Girls in ICT The Gambia website design and development competition. 

The main folder you will find two folders called styleguide-and-modules-library and girlsinict.gm 

The girlsinict.gm folder is the deployed site of the project which is built from the styleguide and concurrently with the modules-library. 

The styleguide-and-modules-library serves as a documentation and a collection of re-usable modules that can be use in the deployed website. 
The purpose of this is to help maintain consistency across the site, help keep a guide which others can follow, make development easy and 
faster by copying and pasting modules from the library to the site and later for CMS integration.

The humans.txt file has the humans responsible & technology colophon that is use across this project.

The robots.txt file contains search engine crawling for all content on the site
